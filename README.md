Cura Profile Analyzer
===================

This will allow the user to select two existing profiles, highlight the differences, and create or update a third profile if desired.


Packaging
---------

To package your plug-in, use the packaging script in Uranium: https://github.com/Ultimaker/Uranium/blob/master/create_plugin.py

Try the following command:

    python3 /path/to/Uranium/create_plugin.py /path/to/UraniumExampleExtensionPlugin

That should produce a .plugin file that can be added to any application based on Uranium.
